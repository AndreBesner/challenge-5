# Challenge 5 - The Daily Calendar

## Description

This project has been created and deployed in order to further myself, Andre Besner's, understanding of Third Party API's

This project especially helped me understand the powerful and awesome DayJS library.

## Installation

There is no additional installation. Just navigate to: https://andrebesner.github.io/challenge-5-calendar/

Tested on current dev version of Google Chrome as of April 06, 2023.

## Usage

To use site, literally just write what you need into the hour time block you want it saved in. For example, dentist at 10am? Type dentist into 10am box and click save.

When you navigate back to page your entries will persist. Grey means time has passed. Red means time is now. Green means time is in future.

## Credits

This code was built on the foundation provided by UofT and EdX's bootcamp program.

This project could not have been finished without the expert teaching of bootcamp instructors Daler Singh and Adam Nyx.

The code for writing back my messy, locally saved user text data from local storage to screen was written with help from Open AI's chatGPT. Sourced inline with code.
